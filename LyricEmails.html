                        <p>Recognizing the challenges hotel staff face in responding to numerous customer queries, this project aims to provide an automated and efficient solution using NLP. The goal was to create a system that could accurately understand and address customer questions quickly, allowing staff to focus on other tasks.</p>
                        <p>The system leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to understand and categorize customer queries, providing tailored responses that align with the hotel's brand tone and voice.</p>
