                        <h3>Inspiration and Journey</h3>
                        <p>While working for a 4-star hotel, I noticed the significant amount of time that hotel managers spend responding to the infinite number of client reviews. Then the idea came to my mind: why not build an AI application that could solve this problem? I began researching this topic, which became a passion for me. During this process, I also encountered some responses from hotels that made me laugh: <span role="img" aria-label="laughter emoji">ðŸ˜‚</span></p>
                        <p>This application helps hotel managers by automating the process of responding to client reviews. It provides tailored responses for each review, helping managers quickly address client feedback while maintaining their brand's tone.</p>
